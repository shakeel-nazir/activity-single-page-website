    <h2>Finding the Perfect Pair of Sun Glasses</h2>
   
    
    <p class=p1>Finding the perfect pair of sunglasses is no day at the beach.
The right shades can make anyone look effortlessly chic, and with the sun-soaked days of summer right around the corner, itâ€™s more important than ever to stock up.<em>"Sunglasses not only make you look cool, they also are very important for your health," says Dr. Jessica Krant</em>, an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at suny Downstate Medical Center in New York. <em>"A good pair of sunglasses can even save your life. The ultraviolet radiation from the sun can get in through the pupil and case damage to the retina. This can lead to an increased risk of not only macular degeneration over time, but also melanoma in the pigment cells of the retina, which can be extra deadly."</em> </p>
